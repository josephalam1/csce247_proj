Commit 1 - Joseph Alam - 12:02am :
- Pushed local changes to avoid merge conflict, don't remember what the changes were

Commit 2 - Joseph Alam - 12:51am :
- Changed User class to interface, removed attributes (just learned interfaces cannot have 
   attributes, only methods), added deleteUser function to all User classes to add for moderator 
   to delete later

Commit 3 - Joseph Alam - :
- Added Applications.java - handles creating a list of application objects to interact with for use 
   for other classes
- Changed Application.java:
  Removed:
    private String pastWorkName;
    private String pastJobTitle;
    private ArrayList<String> pastJobDuties;
    private int pastWorkStrtDate;
    private int pastWorkEndDate;
  As there were already in the Experiences.java class

  Added:
    - id: UUID
    - studentId: UUID
    - jobPostingId: UUID
    - applicationDate: Date
    - coverLetter: String
    - accepted: boolean
    - getApplicationDate(): Date
    - setCoverLetter(String coverLetter): void
   For making connections from applications object to other objects

- Changed Company.java:
  Because of the changes in Application.java, the sort method for Company had to be changed. Changed to now compare
  by applicationDate instead of pastJobTitle
